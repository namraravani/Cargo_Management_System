# Cargo_Management_System
So, This project is part of my academics in which I have made a project on cargo management and the code is written in HTML,CSS,JS and PHP for more details read "readme" file.

A cargo management system is a software application that enables businesses to manage and track the movement of goods and materials from one location to another. It streamlines the entire process of cargo transportation, from planning and scheduling to tracking and delivery.

The cargo management system provides a centralized platform that allows businesses to manage their cargo operations efficiently. It provides real-time visibility into cargo movements, enabling businesses to track shipments, monitor inventory levels, and manage their supply chain effectively.

The system typically includes features such as order management, shipment tracking, inventory management, transportation management, and reporting and analytics. It can also integrate with other systems, such as accounting software and warehouse management systems, to provide a complete end-to-end solution.

Overall, a cargo management system can help businesses to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance customer satisfaction by providing accurate and timely information about their cargo operations.
